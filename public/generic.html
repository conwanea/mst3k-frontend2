            <p>
              Mystery Science Theater 3000 (abbreviated as MST3K) is an American television comedy series created by
              Joel Hodgson and currently produced by Alternaversal Productions, LLC. The show premiered on KTMA-TV (now
              WUCW) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 24, 1988. It later aired on The Comedy Channel/Comedy Central
              for seven seasons until its cancellation in 1996. Thereafter, it was picked up by The Sci-Fi Channel and
              aired for three seasons until another cancellation in August 1999. A 60-episode syndication package titled
              The Mystery Science Theater Hour was produced in 1993 and syndicated to stations in 1995. In 2015, Hodgson
              led a crowdfunded revival of the series with 14 episodes in its eleventh season, first released on Netflix
              on April 14, 2017, with another six-episode season following on November 22, 2018. As of 2019, 217
              episodes and a feature film have been produced as well as two live tours.
            </p>

            <p>
              The show initially starred Hodgson as Joel Robinson, a janitor trapped by two mad scientists ("The Mads")
              on the Earth-orbiting Satellite of Love, and forced to watch a series of B movies in order to monitor his
              reaction to them. To keep his sanity, Joel crafts sentient robot companions, including Tom Servo, Crow T.
              Robot, and Gypsy, to keep him company and help him humorously comment on each movie as it plays, a process
              known as riffing. Each two-hour episode would feature a single movie (often edited for time constraints),
              sometimes preceded by various old shorts and educational films, with Joel, Tom, and Crow watching in
              silhouette from a row of theater seats at the bottom of the screen. These "theater segments" were framed
              with interstitial sketches called "host segments". The show's cast changed over its duration; most
              notably, the character of Joel was replaced by Mike Nelson (played by Michael J. Nelson) halfway through
              the show's fifth season. Other cast members, most of whom were also writers for the show, include Trace
              Beaulieu, Josh Weinstein, Jim Mallon, Kevin Murphy, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, Bill Corbett, Paul
              Chaplin, and Bridget Jones Nelson. The 2017 revival features a primarily new cast, including Jonah Ray who
              plays the new human test subject Jonah Heston, along with Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as "The Mads" and
              Baron Vaughn, Hampton Yount, and Rebecca Hanson voicing Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy, respectively.

              MST3K's original run did not garner high viewership numbers. However, the show's popularity spread through
              online word-of-mouth by its fans known as "MSTies" or "Mysties" (who would remind others to "Keep
              circulating the tapes"), frequent repeats, syndication, and home media offerings produced by Rhino
              Entertainment. Currently, this popularity continues through Shout! Factory, who along with Hodgson, now
              own the rights to the show and supported the revived series. MST3K was listed as one of Time magazine's
              "100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME" in 2007, and TV Guide has noted MST3K as one of the top cult television
              shows. The show won a Peabody Award in 1993,[2] was also nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1994 and 1995,
              and for the CableACE Award from 1992 to 1997. The show was considered highly influential, contributing
              towards the practice of social television, and former cast members launched similar projects based on the
              riffing of films, including The Film Crew, RiffTrax (ongoing as of 2020), and Cinematic Titanic. MST3K
              also brought to light several older movies that had fallen into obscurity or had received little or no
              public attention when originally released. Many of these films were subsequently identified as among the
              worst movies ever made, most notably Manos: The Hands of Fate.

            <h2>Premise</h2>
            <p>
              While the cast of MST3K has changed throughout its history, the basic premise of the show remains
              consistent: a human test subject—first Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson), then Mike Nelson (Michael J. Nelson),
              and most recently Jonah Heston (Jonah Ray)—has been imprisoned aboard the spacecraft Satellite of Love by
              mad scientists (collectively called "The Mads") and is forced to watch a series of bad movies in order to
              find one that will drive the test subject insane. In an attempt to keep his sanity, Joel built sentient
              robots ("the bots") from parts aboard the Satellite of Love, and they subsequently remained aboard with
              Joel's successors as test subjects. The Bots include Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, Gypsy (who is in charge of
              satellite operations) and Cambot, the silent recorder of the experiments. Crow and Servo join the human
              test subject in watching the film in the satellite's theater. To keep from going mad, the trio frequently
              comment and wisecrack during the movie, a process known as "riffing". At regular intervals throughout the
              movie, the hosts leave the theater and return to the bridge of the satellite to perform sketches (commonly
              called "host segments") that often satirize the film being watched.

            <h2>Format</h2>
            <p>
              The general format of an MST3K episode has remained the same throughout the series' run. Episodes are
              approximately 90 minutes in running time (excluding commercial breaks) and begin with a short introductory
              segment in which the human host and the 'bots interact with the Mads before being sent the movie. During
              Joel Hodgson and Jonah Ray's tenures as hosts (and for a brief period at the start of the Mike Nelson
              era), the hosts and the Mads engage in an "invention exchange" in which they each show off their latest
              inventions. Sirens and flashing lights ("Movie Sign") then signal the characters to enter the theater.In
              the theater, the human host and 'bots' Tom and Crow sit in a row of theater seats, shown in silhouette
              along the bottom of the screen, an approach Hodgson called "Shadowramma". The three then riff on the film
              (which is sometimes accompanied by one or more shorts) as it plays for both them and the audience.
              Occasionally the silhouette format is used as a source of humor or as a means of creating unobtrusive
              censor bars for scenes containing nudity. The show transitions into and out of the theater via a "door
              sequence", a series of six doors that open or close as the camera (ostensibly Cambot) passes through them.
              At regular intervals throughout the episode, the characters leave the theater and perform sketches usually
              inspired by the events of the film or short being shown, frequently making use of original songs and prop
              comedy. Some sketches bring in new or recurring characters or other devices; the host would consult an
              external camera "Rocket Number Nine" to show events happening outside the Satellite, and the "Hexfield
              Viewscreen" would be used to communicate with other characters from the ship's bridge. At the end of each
              sketch, "Movie Sign" is triggered again and the characters must re-enter the theater. During Hodgson's
              period on the show, the final sketch aboard the Satellite often included reading of fan mail from the
              "MST3K Info Club". Fan mail readings decreased during Mike Nelson's tenure as host and were dropped
              entirely once the show moved onto the Sci-Fi Channel. The final sketch of an episode typically ends on the
              Mads, with the lead Mad asking their lackey to "push the button" to end the transmission and transitioning
              to the credit sequence. After the credits, a humorous short clip from the featured film (or the
              accompanying short, on occasion) is replayed as a "stinger" to end the episode. In November 1993, a
              limited selection of episodes were repackaged into an hour-long show titled Mystery Science Theater Hour,
              meant to be better suited for off-network syndication. In these, the original episode was split into two
              parts of roughly 45 minutes each excluding commercials. New skits leading and ending each episode
              incorporated Mike Nelson portraying television host Jack Perkins in a parody of Perkins' Biography series
              in mock flattery of the MST3K episode being shown.
